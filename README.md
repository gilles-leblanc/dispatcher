dispatcher
==========

## Find potential GitHub projects to contribute to.

Dispatcher uses the GitHub API to search repos and present those which seem like a good fit to begin contributing to. Dispatcher was created to help me find repos to contribute to on a tight time budget. While looking for such repos I realized this can be harder than it seems. While Dispatcher can't guarantee results, it will help shorten the time it takes to find these repos.

These results can be accessed through a GitHub Page.

Dispatcher looks at several factors all of which are configurable. The goal of the standard configuration is to find active repos with open issues that have accepted pull requests in the past and that do not have too many uncommented open pull requests.
