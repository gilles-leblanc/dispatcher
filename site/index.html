    <p>Dispatcher uses the GitHub API to search repos and find those which seem like a good fit to begin contributing to. While dispatcher can't guarantee results, it will help shorten the time it takes to find these repos.</p>
    <p>It is aimed primarly at people getting started into the world of open source contribution.</p>
    <p>Some other existing sites require project owners to signify they are looking for help and can rapidly fall out of date. Others are automated but simply lists active projects with tons of issues but that may not be conductive to people starting out contributing.</p>

    <h3>
      <a name="what-does-it-do" class="anchor" href="#what-does-it-do"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What does it do?</h3>

    <p>Dispatcher searches GitHub repos and find those with open issues, that have recently been active, that have recently accepted pull requests and that do not have too many uncommented standing pull requests. Dispatcher will also tend to look for mid-sized repos. While other repos are also good for contribution, the repos selected by dispatcher are currently accepting pull requests and have open issues that need to be adressed.</p>
    <p>As we go forward, dispatcher will improve it's results.</p>

    <p>If you came here looking to contribute to a project, also consider contributing to dispatcher. Feel free to fork and submit pull requests, submit issues and suggestions on how dispatcher's current results could be improved.</p>
